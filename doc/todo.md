- [x] Decode CableCheckRes."DC_EVSEStatus.EVSEStatusCode": dinDC_EVSEStatusCodeType as readable text
- [x] Decode CableCheckRes."DC_EVSEStatus.EVSEIsolationStatus": dinisolationLevelType as readable text
- [x] Encoder: PreChargeReq: is it possible to enable the units for EVTargetVoltage and EVTargetCurrent?
- [x] Encoder: CurrentDemandReq: is it possible to enable the units for EVTargetVoltage and EVTargetCurrent?
- [x] Find out, why Alpi reports CableCheckRes = Finished FAILED in v0.4
- [x] Find out, why Compleo ignores the PowerDeliveryReq START in v0.4
- [x] Add date/time into ExiLog
- [x] PevMode: Add state transition in case of failed CableCheck
- [x] PevMode: PreChargeReq: Fill EVRESSSOC, EVTargetVoltage, EVTargetCurrent
- [x] PevMode: PowerDeliveryReq: Fill EVRESSSOC, Stop/Start
- [x] PevMode: CurrentDemandReq: Fill EVRESSSOC, EVTargetCurrent, EVTargetVoltage
- [x] EvseMode: CurrentDemandRes: Fill EVSEPresentVoltage, EVSEPresentCurrent, EVSEMaximumVoltageLimit, ...LimitAchieved
- [x] EvseMode: Fill V2G messages as far as needed, to convince the car to accept it.
- [x] PevMode: Fill V2G messages as far as needed, to convince the charger to accept it.
- [x] PevMode: Find out the SLAC issue on Supercharger and Compleo.
- [x] PevMode: Connect the inlet voltage measurement
- [x] PevMode: Connect the control of CP
- [x] PevMode: Connect the control of Relay
- [x] docu: add link to evse which provides the 5% PWM)
- [ ] docu: add hardwareInterface into software architecture puml
- [ ] docu: create hardware architecture picture
- [x] docu for Dieter (Schematic, concept idea, DieterLV, DieterHV, ...)
- [x] add OLED display to the PEV controller
- [ ] in addressManager, replace the print by addToTrace
- [ ] Resolve the todo-markers in the code
- [x] Still fixed addresses (MAC, IP?) used on windows, add auto-detection or configuration
- [x] configurable interface name and simplify address determination (see https://openinverter.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=54659#p54659)
- [x] in the SessionSetupRequest we need to set the EVCCID with the MAC of the car. At the moment this is not implemented, need to update in the OpenV2Gx the function encodeSessionSetupRequest(), also the fsmPev.py, and provide the MAC as command line parameter from the python to the OpenV2Gx. (see https://openinverter.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=54667#p54667)
- [x] integrate celeron55s hardware interface, use config options for this.
- [x] configurable serial interface and baud rate
- [ ] add plausibilization between EVSEPresentVoltage and physicalVoltage before closing contactors (configurable)
- [ ] find out how a normal end of charging session works (Stopped on charger, stopped on car)
- [x] PevMode: Evaluate the error code reported by the charger, and enter into state stateUnrecoverableError. 
- [ ] Configurable pathes in sharter.sh
- [x] A timeout during PreCharging shall run into the safe shutdown sequence. Same for CableCheck.
- [ ] (and some more)
